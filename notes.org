* Things we want to cover

** Theoretical side

*** Notion of greatest fixed point

*** Coinductive reasoning principle: based on Tarski's principle
    TODO : double check if that's the same thing as "Park's principle" or if there's a difference

*** Reasoning up-to
    Definition, sound closure, respectful class, yadi yada

*** Parameterized coinduction

*** Generalized parameterized coinduction

** Coq side

*** Reduction rules, frob

*** Positive, negative

*** Subject reduction is broken 

*** Guardedness

*** paco

*** gpaco

** Examples

*** Finite automaton -> infinite properties

*** Infinite state machine -> infinite object

*** Streams

*** ITrees

*** Pi-calculus?
